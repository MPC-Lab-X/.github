# MPC Lab

## Introduction

Welcome to the MPC Lab organization! We are dedicated to providing powerful tools for generating random questions in mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Our platform is designed to enhance learning and teaching by offering dynamic question generation, educational tools, and customizable solutions.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Question Generator:** Generate questions randomly with no reliance on a pre-existing question bank. Our models offer thousands of adjustable parameters, allowing teachers to generate highly specific questions.
- **Educational Tools:** Includes a variety of calculators and simulators, such as matrix calculators, n-dimensional equation solvers, acceleration calculators, and celestial body motion models.
- **Customizable Solutions:** Easily adjust parameters for problem generation, ensuring that each assessment meets the specific needs of your students.
- **Community Support:** Join our growing community of educators and developers dedicated to improving educational tools and resources.
